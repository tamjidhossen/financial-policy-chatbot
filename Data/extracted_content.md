# **1.2 FINANCIAL POLICY OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES** **STATEMENT**

The presentation and preparation of the Territory’s Budget is provided for in sections 11 and
11A of the _Financial Management Act 1996_ (the Act).


The purpose of the financial policy objectives and strategies statement is to make transparent
the Government’s financial strategies and to establish a benchmark for evaluating the
Government’s conduct of financial policy. The statement is also consistent with section
11(1)(a) of the Act.


_Strategic Priorities and Financial Policy_


In this budget, the Government continues its commitment to the principles of responsible
financial management.


The financial objectives and the key measures below outline the Government’s financial
policy. Strategic priorities, as they relate to the Territory’s Budget, are summarised as:


  - maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle;


  - maintain low levels of debt;


  - provide the highest possible standard of government services;


  - service delivery which focuses on people, the environment and building prosperity;


  - maintain a triple A credit rating; and


  - effective integration of economic and environmental considerations to promote
sustainability of service delivery.


The 2005-06 Budget and Forward Estimates have been prepared taking into account the need
to provide sustainable social and economic services and infrastructure to the community and
the objective of ecologically sustainable development, as required by the Act. Future
Budgets will over time, as these principles become more firmly integrated with decision
making processes, demonstrate stronger linkages with these principles.


The Budget is economically sustainable. The Budget provides an aggregate surplus over four
years. Short and long-term financial indicators are sound. Cash reserves are reducing
through to 2006-07 but are forecast to grow in 2008-09, and notably, general government
borrowings have not increased.


The Budget is socially responsible. Considerable resources are directed into key service
delivery areas, such as health, education, child and family support. In many cases, these
resources are dedicated to meeting the increasing demand of a growing and ageing
population; for example, hospital waiting lists, dental services, and provision of traineeships
and apprenticeships to meet skill shortages. In other cases, resources are targeted at those
most vulnerable and in need; for example, provision for children with disability, family
violence intervention and complex needs, child protection, and pensioner concessions.

Summary of Table 1.2.1: This table outlines the short-term and long-term financial objectives and key measures for the Government. Short-term objectives include maintaining a Triple A credit rating, low debt, a strategic approach to capital works, and high-standard government services. Long-term objectives focus on Territory infrastructure, provisions for liabilities, and minimizing financial risk. The key measures detail specific targets such as maintaining a balanced budget (2005-06 to 2008-09), capital infrastructure, net interest cost, taxation levels, net assets, achieving 90% coverage of superannuation liabilities by 2039-2040, reducing GGS debt, and implementing risk mitigation systems.

*Maintain a Balanced Budget over the economic cycle*

The balanced budget financial objective is measured by the operating result of the General Government Sector (GGS). A four-year planning horizon recognises that it is not always necessary to deliver surpluses every year without any regard to the broader context of the economy and the service and infrastructure requirements of the community. What is important is that a surplus is delivered over the economic cycle.

**Summary of Table 1.2.2:** This table presents the General Government Sector's operating results and aggregate results for various periods, showing actual, estimated outturn, budgeted, and estimated figures from 2002-03 to 2008-09, all in millions of dollars. The GGS Operating Result shows a trend from surpluses in earlier years to a deficit in the 2005-06 budget, then returning to projected surpluses. Separate aggregate results are provided for two distinct multi-year periods.

While the 2005-06 Budget is in deficit, the Government has introduced significant measures included to return the Budget to surplus, such as savings measures aimed at improved efficiency.

_Maintain the Capital Infrastructure of the Territory_

The capital infrastructure objective of the Territory is measured through the value of current and non-current works in progress, and the value of property, plant and equipment in the Balance Sheet of the Territory.

The Government's target for this measure is to demonstrate and provide for the maintenance of the existing level of physical assets (as at 30 June 2005).

**Summary of Table 1.2.3:** This table details the General Government Sector's capital infrastructure, including Non-Current Capital Works in Progress and Property, Plant and Equipment, from the 2004-05 estimated outturn to the 2008-09 estimate, with all figures in millions of dollars. It indicates a consistent growth in Property, Plant and Equipment, leading to an increasing total capital infrastructure over the forecast period, while capital works in progress fluctuate.

_Maintain net interest cost as a proportion of total own-source revenue for the General Government Sector less than zero_

Net interest is the difference between interest earned on investments and interest paid on debt. Total own-source revenue is the difference between Total Revenue and Commonwealth Grants in the Operating Statement.

This objective provides an indication of the Government's ability to meet its debt obligations without impacting on services, and in the current case for the General Government Sector, a net interest return for the Territory. The Government's target for this measure is to ensure that the level of net interest cost remains negative, indicating the Territory can comfortably meet interest expenses.

Summary of Table 1.2.4: This table details the General Government Sector's net interest expense as a percentage of own-source revenue from 2004-05 to 2008-09. It shows Interest Expense, Interest Revenue, Net Interest Cost, Own Source Revenue (all in $m), and the Net Interest Cost as a percentage of Own Source Revenue. The Net Interest Cost is projected to remain negative and decrease over the years, indicating effective debt management.

*Maintain levels of taxation as a proportion of GSP*

The objective of maintaining taxation levels as a proportion of GSP (Gross State Product) ensures that levels of tax burden on the community do not increase disproportionally to the level of economic activity of the Territory.

### Table 1.2.5 General Government Sector Proportion of Taxation Revenue to Gross State Product

| Item                             | 2004-05 Est. Out. | 2005-06 Budget | 2006-07 Estimate | 2007-08 Estimate | 2008-09 Estimate |

Summary of Table 1.2.5: This table presents the General Government Sector's taxation revenue and Gross State Product (GSP) in millions of dollars, along with taxation as a percentage of GSP, for the years 2004-05 to 2008-09. It indicates a slight increase in taxation as a percentage of GSP over the projected period.

*Maintain or increase the Territory's Net Assets*

This objective's aim is to budget for an increase (or maintenance) of the level of net assets of the Territory. This represents the difference between Total Assets and Total Liabilities represented on the Balance Sheet.

Summary of Table 1.2.6: This table outlines the total assets, total liabilities, and net assets for the Territory from 2004-05 (estimated actual) to 2008-09 (estimated forecast), with all financial figures presented in millions of dollars ($m). The table projects a gradual increase in total assets, total liabilities, and consequently, total territory net assets over this five-year period.

*90% coverage of accrued superannuation liabilities by 2039-40*

This objective is measured by the extent to which the accrued and projected superannuation liability is funded. The Government has a commitment to fund 90% of accrued superannuation liabilities by 30 June 2040. In light of the significantly lower projected liabilities following the introduction of the PSS accumulation scheme, this target date will be reviewed during 2005-06 with a view to determining whether an earlier date should be adopted. The outcome of this process will be reported in the 2006-07 Budget.

### Table 1.2.7
Percentage funding of Superannuation Liabilities

| 30 June | Assets ($'000) | Liabilities ($'000) | % Funded |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **2005** | 1 447 094 | 2 480 943 | 58% |

| **2009** | 2 266 537 | 3 365 107 | 67% |

Summary of Table 1.2.7: This table details the percentage funding of superannuation liabilities for the Territory as of 30 June for the years 2005 through 2009. It presents the total assets and total liabilities associated with superannuation in thousands of dollars ($'000) and shows a consistent year-on-year increase in the percentage of liabilities funded, moving from 58% in 2005 to 67% in 2009.

### Principles of Responsible Financial Management

The key financial measures established by the Government satisfy various principles of responsible financial management specified within the *Financial Management Act 1996*, these are:

(a) ensuring that the total liabilities of the Territory are at prudent levels to provide a buffer against factors that may impact adversely on the level of total Territory liabilities in the future, and ensuring that, until prudent levels have been achieved, the total operating expenses of the Territory in each financial year are less than its operating income levels in the same financial year;

(b) when prudent levels of total Territory liabilities have been achieved, maintaining the levels by ensuring that, on average, over a reasonable period of time, the total operating expenses of the Territory do not exceed its operating income levels;

==================================================

=== Page 6 ===
Text:

(c) achieving and maintaining levels of Territory net worth to provide a buffer against
factors that may impact adversely on levels of Territory net worth in the future;


(d) managing prudently the fiscal risks of the Territory;


(e) pursuing spending and taxing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of
stability and predictability in the level of the tax burden; and


(f) giving full, accurate and timely disclosure of financial information about the activities
of the government and its agencies.


The key financial objectives outlined earlier in this chapter support the principles of
responsible fiscal management.


The objectives of a balanced budget over the economic cycle, the maintenance of low levels
of debt and adequate provision for long-term liabilities strongly support prudent financial
management and the principles of inter-generational equity.


Expenses must be balanced against revenues, borrowings must be within manageable limits
and repayments affordable from ongoing revenues.


The Territory’s prudent investment policies are designed to protect the value of the
Territory’s more liquid assets thus maintaining this asset base for the settlement of future
liabilities.


A strategic approach to capital works programs reflects a longer term view of key
infrastructure decisions such as the timely delivery of new infrastructure and the timely
replacement of infrastructure balanced against the changing demographics and changing
service delivery needs.


The 2005-06 Budget contains a significant level of funding for new construction and
upgrades of existing infrastructure.


A number of strategic new infrastructure items have been approved for construction or design
in the 2005-06 Budget to enhance services for the people of the ACT. These include a major
new recreational area at Stromlo Forest Park, a new Primary and Pre-School in East
Gungahlin and a replacement for the Quamby Youth Detention Centre. Additional funding
for continuing projects such as the Gungahlin Drive Extension and the Alexander
Maconachie Centre (Correctional Facility) has also been included.


A base level of funding has also been provided for capital upgrades; that is, works which
increase service delivery capacity or extend the useful lives of existing assets. A further
provision has been made to finance capital upgrades through a five-year rolling program.

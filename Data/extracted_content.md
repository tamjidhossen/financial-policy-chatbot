# **1.2 FINANCIAL POLICY OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES** **STATEMENT**

The presentation and preparation of the Territory’s Budget is provided for in sections 11 and
11A of the _Financial Management Act 1996_ (the Act).


The purpose of the financial policy objectives and strategies statement is to make transparent
the Government’s financial strategies and to establish a benchmark for evaluating the
Government’s conduct of financial policy. The statement is also consistent with section
11(1)(a) of the Act.


_Strategic Priorities and Financial Policy_


In this budget, the Government continues its commitment to the principles of responsible
financial management.


The financial objectives and the key measures below outline the Government’s financial
policy. Strategic priorities, as they relate to the Territory’s Budget, are summarised as:


  - maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle;


  - maintain low levels of debt;


  - provide the highest possible standard of government services;


  - service delivery which focuses on people, the environment and building prosperity;


  - maintain a triple A credit rating; and


  - effective integration of economic and environmental considerations to promote
sustainability of service delivery.


The 2005-06 Budget and Forward Estimates have been prepared taking into account the need
to provide sustainable social and economic services and infrastructure to the community and
the objective of ecologically sustainable development, as required by the Act. Future
Budgets will over time, as these principles become more firmly integrated with decision
making processes, demonstrate stronger linkages with these principles.


The Budget is economically sustainable. The Budget provides an aggregate surplus over four
years. Short and long-term financial indicators are sound. Cash reserves are reducing
through to 2006-07 but are forecast to grow in 2008-09, and notably, general government
borrowings have not increased.


The Budget is socially responsible. Considerable resources are directed into key service
delivery areas, such as health, education, child and family support. In many cases, these
resources are dedicated to meeting the increasing demand of a growing and ageing
population; for example, hospital waiting lists, dental services, and provision of traineeships
and apprenticeships to meet skill shortages. In other cases, resources are targeted at those
most vulnerable and in need; for example, provision for children with disability, family
violence intervention and complex needs, child protection, and pensioner concessions.

Finally, the Budget supports community welfare and development. Investments are made with both short and long-term objectives in mind. Various projects associated with implementing the *Shaping Our Territory* plan and ACT Energy Wise Program are provided for, while the *Asbestos Assessment Task Force* helps communicate the risk of asbestos and educates to raise confidence in managing asbestos issues in the community.

Summary of Table 1.2.1: This table outlines the short-term and long-term financial objectives of the government, followed by specific key measures for both categories. The objectives cover areas like credit rating, debt levels, capital works, service provision, infrastructure, and liability management. The key measures detail targets for budget balance (2005-06 to 2008-09), superannuation coverage (by 2039-2040), capital infrastructure, GGS debt, net interest cost, taxation levels, and Net Assets.

*Maintain a Balanced Budget over the economic cycle*
The balanced budget financial objective is measured by the operating result of the General Government Sector (GGS). A four-year planning horizon recognises that it is not always necessary to deliver surpluses every year without any regard to the broader context of the economy and the service and infrastructure requirements of the community. What is important is that a surplus is delivered over the economic cycle.

Summary of Table 1.2.2: This table presents the General Government Sector's operating results and forward estimates from 2002-03 to 2008-09. It includes actual figures for earlier years, estimated outcomes, budget figures, and forward estimates for operating results, alongside two aggregated result figures for different periods.

While the 2005-06 Budget is in deficit, the Government has introduced significant measures included to return the Budget to surplus, such as savings measures aimed at improved efficiency.

*Maintain the Capital Infrastructure of the Territory*
The capital infrastructure objective of the Territory is measured through the value of current and non-current works in progress, and the value of property, plant and equipment in the Balance Sheet of the Territory.

The Government’s target for this measure is to demonstrate and provide for the maintenance of the existing level of physical assets (as at 30 June 2005).

Summary of Table 1.2.3: This table details the General Government Sector's capital infrastructure, including estimated outcomes, budget figures, and forward estimates for non-current capital works in progress and property, plant, and equipment, as well as a sub-total for these categories from 2004-05 to 2008-09.

*Maintain net interest cost as a proportion of total own-source revenue for the General Government Sector less than zero*
Net interest is the difference between interest earned on investments and interest paid on debt. Total own-source revenue is the difference between Total Revenue and Commonwealth Grants in the Operating Statement.

This objective provides an indication of the Government's ability to meet its debt obligations without impacting on services, and in the current case for the General Government Sector, a net interest return for the Territory. The Government's target for this measure is to ensure that the level of net interest cost remains negative, indicating the Territory can comfortably meet interest expenses.

Summary of Table 1.2.4: This table presents the Net Interest Expense of the General Government Sector as a percentage of Own-Source Revenue from 2004-05 to 2008-09. It details Interest Expense, Interest Revenue, Net Interest Cost, Own Source Revenue, and the calculated Net Interest Cost as a percentage of Own Source Revenue, all in millions of dollars ($m) except for the final percentage row.

*Maintain levels of taxation as a proportion of GSP*

The objective of maintaining taxation levels as a proportion of GSP (Gross State Product) ensures that levels of tax burden on the community do not increase disproportionately to the level of economic activity of the Territory.

### Table 1.2.5 General Government Sector Proportion of Taxation Revenue to Gross State Product

| | 2004-05 Est. Out. ($m) | 2005-06 Budget ($m) | 2006-07 Estimate ($m) | 2007-08 Estimate ($m) | 2008-09 Estimate ($m) |
|:---------------------------------------|-------------------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|
| Taxation | 692 | 729 | 778 | 833 | 889 |
| GSP | 16 944 | 17 637 | 18 349 | 19 240 | 20 214 |
| **Taxation as a % of GSP** | **4.1%** | **4.1%** | **4.2%** | **4.3%** | **4.4%** |

Summary of Table 1.2.5: This table illustrates the General Government Sector's proportion of Taxation Revenue to Gross State Product (GSP) from 2004-05 to 2008-09. It provides figures for Taxation and GSP in millions of dollars ($m), and calculates Taxation as a percentage of GSP for each financial year.

*Maintain or increase the Territory's Net Assets*

This objective's aim is to budget for an increase (or maintenance) of the level of net assets of the Territory. This represents the difference between Total Assets and Total Liabilities represented on the Balance Sheet.

**Summary of Table 1.2.6:** This table presents the total assets, total liabilities, and resulting total territory net assets for the period from 2004-05 (estimated outturn) to 2008-09 (estimated figures), with all values expressed in millions of dollars ($m).

*90% coverage of accrued superannuation liabilities by 2039-40*

This objective is measured by the extent to which the accrued and projected superannuation liability is funded. The Government has a commitment to fund 90% of accrued superannuation liabilities by 30 June 2040. In light of the significantly lower projected liabilities following the introduction of the PSS accumulation scheme, this target date will be reviewed during 2005-06 with a view to determining whether an earlier date should be adopted. The outcome of this process will be reported in the 2006-07 Budget.

**Summary of Table 1.2.7:** This table details the assets, liabilities, and the percentage funded for superannuation liabilities as of 30 June each year from 2005 to 2009, with monetary values presented in thousands of dollars ($'000).

*Principles of Responsible Financial Management*

The key financial measures established by the Government satisfy various principles of responsible financial management specified within the *Financial Management Act 1996*, these are:

(a) ensuring that the total liabilities of the Territory are at prudent levels to provide a buffer against factors that may impact adversely on the level of total Territory liabilities in the future, and ensuring that, until prudent levels have been achieved, the total operating expenses of the Territory in each financial year are less than its operating income levels in the same financial year;

(b) when prudent levels of total Territory liabilities have been achieved, maintaining the levels by ensuring that, on average, over a reasonable period of time, the total operating expenses of the Territory do not exceed its operating income levels;

2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3

*Financial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement*

==================================================

Text:

(c) achieving and maintaining levels of Territory net worth to provide a buffer against
factors that may impact adversely on levels of Territory net worth in the future;


(d) managing prudently the fiscal risks of the Territory;


(e) pursuing spending and taxing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of
stability and predictability in the level of the tax burden; and


(f) giving full, accurate and timely disclosure of financial information about the activities
of the government and its agencies.


The key financial objectives outlined earlier in this chapter support the principles of
responsible fiscal management.


The objectives of a balanced budget over the economic cycle, the maintenance of low levels
of debt and adequate provision for long-term liabilities strongly support prudent financial
management and the principles of inter-generational equity.


Expenses must be balanced against revenues, borrowings must be within manageable limits
and repayments affordable from ongoing revenues.


The Territory’s prudent investment policies are designed to protect the value of the
Territory’s more liquid assets thus maintaining this asset base for the settlement of future
liabilities.


A strategic approach to capital works programs reflects a longer term view of key
infrastructure decisions such as the timely delivery of new infrastructure and the timely
replacement of infrastructure balanced against the changing demographics and changing
service delivery needs.


The 2005-06 Budget contains a significant level of funding for new construction and
upgrades of existing infrastructure.


A number of strategic new infrastructure items have been approved for construction or design
in the 2005-06 Budget to enhance services for the people of the ACT. These include a major
new recreational area at Stromlo Forest Park, a new Primary and Pre-School in East
Gungahlin and a replacement for the Quamby Youth Detention Centre. Additional funding
for continuing projects such as the Gungahlin Drive Extension and the Alexander
Maconachie Centre (Correctional Facility) has also been included.


A base level of funding has also been provided for capital upgrades; that is, works which
increase service delivery capacity or extend the useful lives of existing assets. A further
provision has been made to finance capital upgrades through a five-year rolling program.

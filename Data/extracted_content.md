# **1.2 FINANCIAL POLICY OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES** **STATEMENT**

The presentation and preparation of the Territory’s Budget is provided for in sections 11 and
11A of the _Financial Management Act 1996_ (the Act).


The purpose of the financial policy objectives and strategies statement is to make transparent
the Government’s financial strategies and to establish a benchmark for evaluating the
Government’s conduct of financial policy. The statement is also consistent with section
11(1)(a) of the Act.


_Strategic Priorities and Financial Policy_


In this budget, the Government continues its commitment to the principles of responsible
financial management.


The financial objectives and the key measures below outline the Government’s financial
policy. Strategic priorities, as they relate to the Territory’s Budget, are summarised as:


  - maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle;


  - maintain low levels of debt;


  - provide the highest possible standard of government services;


  - service delivery which focuses on people, the environment and building prosperity;


  - maintain a triple A credit rating; and


  - effective integration of economic and environmental considerations to promote
sustainability of service delivery.


The 2005-06 Budget and Forward Estimates have been prepared taking into account the need
to provide sustainable social and economic services and infrastructure to the community and
the objective of ecologically sustainable development, as required by the Act. Future
Budgets will over time, as these principles become more firmly integrated with decision
making processes, demonstrate stronger linkages with these principles.


The Budget is economically sustainable. The Budget provides an aggregate surplus over four
years. Short and long-term financial indicators are sound. Cash reserves are reducing
through to 2006-07 but are forecast to grow in 2008-09, and notably, general government
borrowings have not increased.


The Budget is socially responsible. Considerable resources are directed into key service
delivery areas, such as health, education, child and family support. In many cases, these
resources are dedicated to meeting the increasing demand of a growing and ageing
population; for example, hospital waiting lists, dental services, and provision of traineeships
and apprenticeships to meet skill shortages. In other cases, resources are targeted at those
most vulnerable and in need; for example, provision for children with disability, family
violence intervention and complex needs, child protection, and pensioner concessions.

Finally, the Budget supports community welfare and development. Investments are made with both short and long-term objectives in mind. Various projects associated with implementing the *Shaping Our Territory* plan and ACT *Energy Wise Program* are provided for, while the *Asbestos Assessment Task Force* helps communicate the risk of asbestos and educates to raise confidence in managing asbestos issues in the community.

## Financial Objectives and Key Measures

The following table provides the short-term and long-term financial objectives of the Government.

---TABLE_END---
Summary of Table 1.2.1: This table outlines the financial objectives and key measures of the Government, distinguishing between short-term and long-term goals. Short-term financial objectives include maintaining a Triple A credit rating, low debt, a strategic capital works program, and high standards of government services, considering growth and monetary inflation. Long-term financial objectives focus on maintaining Territory infrastructure, making adequate provision for long-term liabilities, and minimising financial risks. The table then lists key measures: for the short term, these include maintaining a balanced budget over the economic cycle (specifically 2005-06 to 2008-09), the capital infrastructure of the Territory, net interest cost as a proportion of total own-source revenue (less than zero), taxation levels as a proportion of GSP, and increasing or maintaining the Territory's Net Assets. For the long term, key measures include achieving 90% coverage of accrued superannuation liabilities by 2039-2040, maintaining or reducing GGS debt, and implementing adequate systems and processes to recognise and mitigate risk.

*Maintain a Balanced Budget over the economic cycle*

The balanced budget financial objective is measured by the operating result of the General Government Sector (GGS). A four-year planning horizon recognises that it is not always necessary to deliver surpluses every year without any regard to the broader context of the economy and the service and infrastructure requirements of the community. What is important is that a surplus is delivered over the economic cycle.

While the 2005-06 Budget is in deficit, the Government has introduced significant measures included to return the Budget to surplus, such as savings measures aimed at improved efficiency.

*Maintain the Capital Infrastructure of the Territory*

The capital infrastructure objective of the Territory is measured through the value of current and non-current works in progress, and the value of property, plant and equipment in the Balance Sheet of the Territory.

The Government's target for this measure is to demonstrate and provide for the maintenance of the existing level of physical assets (as at 30 June 2005).

It breaks down the capital infrastructure into "Non-Current Capital Works in Progress" and "Property, Plant and Equipment", providing a subtotal for these categories for each fiscal year, with all values presented in millions of dollars.

*Maintain net interest cost as a proportion of total own-source revenue for the General Government Sector less than zero*

Net interest is the difference between interest earned on investments and interest paid on debt. Total own-source revenue is the difference between Total Revenue and Commonwealth Grants in the Operating Statement.

==================================================

This objective provides an indication of the Government's ability to meet its debt obligations without impacting on services, and in the current case for the General Government Sector, a net interest return for the Territory. The Government's target for this measure is to ensure that the level of net interest cost remains negative, indicating the Territory can comfortably meet interest expenses.

The data shows a projected increase in both assets and liabilities, but a consistent increase in net assets over the period.

90% coverage of accrued superannuation liabilities by 2039-40

This objective is measured by the extent to which the accrued and projected superannuation liability is funded. The Government has a commitment to fund 90% of accrued superannuation liabilities by 30 June 2040. In light of the significantly lower projected liabilities following the introduction of the PSS accumulation scheme, this target date will be reviewed during 2005-06 with a view to determining whether an earlier date should be adopted. The outcome of this process will be reported in the 2006-07 Budget.

---TABLE_START---
### Table 1.2.7 Percentage funding of Superannuation Liabilities
| 30 June | Assets $'000 | Liabilities $'000 | % Funded |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2005 | 1 447 094 | 2 480 943 | 58% |

---TABLE_END---
Summary of Table 1.2.7: This table outlines the percentage funding of Superannuation Liabilities for the years ending 30 June from 2005 to 2009. It provides figures for assets and liabilities, both in thousands of dollars ($'000), and calculates the corresponding percentage of liabilities funded for each year. The data indicates a gradual increase in both assets and liabilities, as well as a progressive improvement in the funding percentage, from 58% in 2005 to 67% in 2009.

## Principles of Responsible Financial Management

The key financial measures established by the Government satisfy various principles of responsible financial management specified within the *Financial Management Act 1996*, these are:

1.  ensuring that the total liabilities of the Territory are at prudent levels to provide a buffer against factors that may impact adversely on the level of total Territory liabilities in the future, and ensuring that, until prudent levels have been achieved, the total operating expenses of the Territory in each financial year are less than its operating income levels in the same financial year;
2.  when prudent levels of total Territory liabilities have been achieved, maintaining the levels by ensuring that, on average, over a reasonable period of time, the total operating expenses of the Territory do not exceed its operating income levels;

2005-06 Budget Paper No. 3 9 Financial Policy Objectives and Strategies Statement

==================================================

=== Page 6 ===
Text:

(c) achieving and maintaining levels of Territory net worth to provide a buffer against
factors that may impact adversely on levels of Territory net worth in the future;


(d) managing prudently the fiscal risks of the Territory;


(e) pursuing spending and taxing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of
stability and predictability in the level of the tax burden; and


(f) giving full, accurate and timely disclosure of financial information about the activities
of the government and its agencies.


The key financial objectives outlined earlier in this chapter support the principles of
responsible fiscal management.


The objectives of a balanced budget over the economic cycle, the maintenance of low levels
of debt and adequate provision for long-term liabilities strongly support prudent financial
management and the principles of inter-generational equity.


Expenses must be balanced against revenues, borrowings must be within manageable limits
and repayments affordable from ongoing revenues.


The Territory’s prudent investment policies are designed to protect the value of the
Territory’s more liquid assets thus maintaining this asset base for the settlement of future
liabilities.


A strategic approach to capital works programs reflects a longer term view of key
infrastructure decisions such as the timely delivery of new infrastructure and the timely
replacement of infrastructure balanced against the changing demographics and changing
service delivery needs.


The 2005-06 Budget contains a significant level of funding for new construction and
upgrades of existing infrastructure.


A number of strategic new infrastructure items have been approved for construction or design
in the 2005-06 Budget to enhance services for the people of the ACT. These include a major
new recreational area at Stromlo Forest Park, a new Primary and Pre-School in East
Gungahlin and a replacement for the Quamby Youth Detention Centre. Additional funding
for continuing projects such as the Gungahlin Drive Extension and the Alexander
Maconachie Centre (Correctional Facility) has also been included.


A base level of funding has also been provided for capital upgrades; that is, works which
increase service delivery capacity or extend the useful lives of existing assets. A further
provision has been made to finance capital upgrades through a five-year rolling program.
